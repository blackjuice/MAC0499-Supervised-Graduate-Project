# Code Template for Blender Add-ons
This is an empty template to help you organize your Blender Add-on code. You can even install the template itself and enable it as an add-on! It doesn't do a whole heck of a lot, but it proves the code works. Enjoy!

# What's the big deal?
I use my free time to create cool things and release them - for free - on my website, [www.aaronpowell.me](http://www.aaronpowell.me). 3D models, animations, pictures, code snippets, publications, you name it (the code for the website is even open-sourced)!

All of the resources you need to remake (or tinker around with) these projects are available to download, whether it's 3D files, image textures, videos, code, or text documents, and everything is made using free or completely open-source software so you have access to everything you need to follow along.

If you like what I do and want to see more, [consider becoming a Patreon supporter](http://www.patreon.com/aaronpowell). 10% of your monthly support is donated to the amazing open-source initiatives that help make these projects happen.

# How to download
Please don't fork this project if you want to make your own Blender Add-ons based on this template. Instead, download as a zip file or clone to your hard drive and copy + paste it into your own project.
    
    git clone https://github.com/maxnewton/blender-addon-template
    cp ./blender-addon-template/* /path/to/your/project/folder
